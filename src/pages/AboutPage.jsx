        <h2>Help ambitious teams ship reliable, intelligent systems</h2>
        <p>
          We exist to close the gap between technical ambition and operational reality.
          Whether a team needs a modern web platform, an AI agent evaluation framework,
          or a staffing partner that understands delivery culture — OmiO provides the
          engineering depth and execution discipline to make it happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in {companyInfo.founded}, OmiO started as a small engineering practice
          with a clear belief: the best technology work comes from teams that care about
          craft and communicate honestly. That belief still drives everything we do.

        <h2>Distributed, deliberate, and dependable</h2>
        <p>
          OmiO operates as a remote-first company with team members across Europe, Asia,
          and North America. We structure work around asynchronous communication, clear
          ownership, and short feedback loops — so timezone differences become an advantage,
          not a bottleneck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every engagement begins with a discovery phase where we align on goals, constraints,
          and success criteria. From there, we work in focused delivery cycles with regular
          check-ins, transparent progress updates, and a shared commitment to shipping on time.
