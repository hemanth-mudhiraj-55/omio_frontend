    intro:
      "If you've spent the last two years watching AI & automation demos that never quite made it to production, you're not alone. Enterprise AI agents promise a lot — and for good reason. When they work, they genuinely transform how teams operate. But most organizations are still figuring out where agents actually fit, what they need to run reliably, and how to evaluate whether the investment is worth it. This guide cuts through the noise.",

            q: 'How many test cases do I need for AI agent benchmarking?',

            q: 'What are the best AI benchmarking tools for enterprise teams?',
            a: 'LangSmith is best for LangChain teams. Braintrust is best for framework-agnostic teams needing a dedicated AI benchmarking platform. Evidently AI is best for production monitoring. W&B Weave is best for large-scale model comparison. A custom pytest suite is often best when your criteria are still evolving.',

Better production monitoring and more representative test datasets fix most of these.',
